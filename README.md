# CrediTrust RAG Complaint Chatbot

**Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services**  
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered internal chatbot that turns raw customer complaint data into actionable insights for CrediTrust Financial.

## Project Goal

CrediTrust Financial is a fast-growing digital finance company serving East African markets with products including **Credit Cards**, **Personal Loans**, **Savings Accounts**, and **Money Transfers**. With over 500,000 users and thousands of monthly complaints, internal teams (Product, Support, Compliance) struggle to quickly identify emerging issues from unstructured narrative text.
This project builds an **internal AI tool** that enables non-technical stakeholders (e.g., Product Manager Asha) to ask plain-English questions like:

- “Why are people unhappy with Credit Cards?”
- “What are the most common fraud issues in Savings Accounts?”
  and receive **concise, evidence-backed answers in seconds**, sourced directly from real customer complaints.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Reduce time to identify major complaint trends from **days to minutes**
- Empower non-technical teams to get insights without data analysts
- Shift from reactive to **proactive** issue resolution using real-time feedback
